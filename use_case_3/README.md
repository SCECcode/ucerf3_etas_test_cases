# Use case #3

This use case runs 10k simulations on several nodes (currently set to 14 nodes). It takes around 45 minutes to run on Expanse. After the simulations complete, the plotting script is invoked and all plots will be generated in a 'plots' folder.

# Storage Requirements

* Input file size: 81kb
* After simulation and plots: 4.3GB
